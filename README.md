Hello everyone!
This is my second project — a simple online store called KhalTech, where I showcase Logitech G gaming headphones.
The site is currently a static version hosted on GitHub Pages, so there’s no backend functionality (like cart or payments), but it gives a good idea of the layout and design I had in mind.
Thanks for checking it out!
